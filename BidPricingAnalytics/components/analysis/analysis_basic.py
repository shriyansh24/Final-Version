            ### What This Analysis Shows
            
            The histograms display the distribution of CPI values for won and lost bids, 
            revealing the price ranges that are most common in each category.
            
            ### Key Insights
            
            1. **Price Range Comparison**: Won bids typically have a lower CPI range compared to lost bids,
               indicating that competitive pricing is important for winning projects.
            
            2. **Distribution Shape**: The shape of the distribution provides insights into pricing patterns.
               A narrower distribution suggests more consistent pricing, while a wider distribution indicates
               more variable pricing based on project factors.
            
            3. **Overlap Areas**: Where the distributions overlap represents the competitive pricing zone
               where other factors besides price (such as reputation, capabilities, relationships) may
               determine bid success.
            
            4. **Pricing Thresholds**: The mean values (vertical dashed lines) can be used as reference
               points for setting competitive pricing thresholds.

            ### Understanding the IR-CPI Relationship
            
            Incidence Rate (IR) is the percentage of people who qualify for a survey. It has a significant
            impact on CPI because it affects how difficult it is to find qualified respondents.
            
            ### Key Insights
            
            1. **Inverse Relationship**: As shown in both charts, there's generally an inverse relationship
               between IR and CPI - as IR increases, CPI tends to decrease. This is logical because higher
               incidence rates mean less screening effort is needed.
            
            2. **Price Gap by IR Level**: The bar chart reveals that the gap between won and lost CPIs
               varies across IR bins. This can help identify where competitive pricing sensitivity is highest.
            
            3. **Pricing Strategy**: For lower IR ranges (0-30%), pricing sensitivity appears higher,
               suggesting that competitive pricing is especially important for low-IR projects.
            
            4. **Diminishing Returns**: The benefit of higher IR on CPI appears to flatten above certain
               IR thresholds, suggesting that very high IR doesn't necessarily enable proportionally lower pricing.
